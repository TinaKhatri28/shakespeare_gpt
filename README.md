# Shakespeare GPT

Shakespeare GPT is a domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM) project designed to generate and analyze text in the style of William Shakespeare. The project demonstrates fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) and language modeling concepts, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and sequence-based text generation.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a mini GPT-style language model trained on Shakespearean literature. It highlights how language models learn vocabulary, grammar, and stylistic patterns from classical text data.

## Features

- Shakespeare-style text generation
- NLP-based text preprocessing and tokenization
- Sequence modeling for next-token prediction
- End-to-end LLM workflow implemented in Python
- Interactive experimentation using Jupyter Notebook

---

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch / TensorFlow (as applicable)  
- Concepts: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Language Modeling, Deep Learning, LLMs  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
